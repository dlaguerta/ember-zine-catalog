# Zine Dreams Catalog (Ember Front-End)

The Zine Dreams Catalog is a project developed by Dianne Laguerta, inspired by the many zine librarians building a [zine union catalog](http://zinelibraries.info/zine-union-catalog/). It began as a capstone project during their time at the [Ada Developers Academy](wwww.adadevelopersacademy.org) This repo is dedicated to front-end application of the project, using Ember.
